# Individual Threading Implementation - Summary

## What Changed

The Slack integration now posts each trending story as a **separate channel message** with its **own dedicated thread** for analysis details.

## Before vs After

### Before (Consolidated)

```
One message listing all stories
└─ Thread with all story details
```

### After (Individual)

```
Story 1 summary → Thread with story 1 details
Story 2 summary → Thread with story 2 details
Story 3 summary → Thread with story 3 details
```

## Key Changes

### 1. New Formatter Method

**`format_individual_story_summary()`**

- Replaces: `format_slim_channel_message()`
- Creates compact summary for ONE story
- Shows: number emoji, title, counts, source
- Prompts: "Click thread below for full analysis"

### 2. Updated Action Scheduler

**`process_trending_news_analysis()`**

- Loops through each story
- Posts summary to channel
- Posts full analysis as thread reply
- 0.5 second delay between stories

### 3. Removed Methods

- `send_threaded_analysis()` - No longer needed
- Individual posting replaces batch threading

## Benefits

✅ **Focused discussions** - Each story gets its own conversation
✅ **Easy referencing** - "Look at 2️⃣" vs "check thread reply 2"
✅ **Better reactions** - React to specific stories
✅ **Modular sharing** - Share individual stories
✅ **Natural threading** - One topic = one thread

## What Users See

When running `/trending-news category:tech articles:3`:

1. **Three separate messages appear** (~0.5s apart)
2. **Each message shows**:
    - Number emoji + headline
    - Angle and report counts
    - Source link
    - Thread prompt
3. **Each has [1 reply]** with full analysis
4. **Total time**: ~3 seconds for 3 stories

## Example

**Channel:**

```
1️⃣ AI Regulations lessens after Pfizer deal

## Technical Details

- **Rate limiting**: 0.5s delay between messages

- **Error handling**: Tracks success count, falls back if needed
- **API calls**: Uses `chat.postMessage` for both summary and thread
- **Link previews**: Disabled (`unfurl_links: false`)
- **Text cleaning**: Removes literal `\n` characters
