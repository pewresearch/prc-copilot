# Threading Update Summary

## 🎉 What Changed

The Slack bot now uses a **two-part response** with threading:

### Before (Single Large Message)

```
📰 Trending News Analysis Complete
[Entire analysis in one big message - 3000+ characters]
[All stories, angles, links in channel]
[Hard to scan, clutters channel]
```

### After (Main + Thread)

```
Main Channel:
📰 3 stories found with headlines & counts

Thread:
→ Story 1 (full details)
→ Story 2 (full details)
→ Story 3 (full details)
```

## ✨ Benefits

1. **Cleaner Channels** - Main message ~200-600 chars instead of 3000+
2. **Scannable** - See headlines without clicking
3. **Organized** - Full details in thread
4. **Discussable** - Reply to specific stories
5. **Professional** - Looks much better
