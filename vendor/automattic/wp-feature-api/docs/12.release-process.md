# WordPress Feature API Release Process

This document outlines the release process for the WordPress Feature API, which handles multiple distribution formats to reach different types of users.

## Distribution Formats

The WordPress Feature API is distributed in three formats:

1. **WordPress Plugin ZIP** - For WordPress site owners who want to install the plugin directly
2. **Composer Package** - For WordPress plugin developers who want to include the API in their plugins
3. **NPM Package** - For JavaScript developers who want to use the client-side SDK

## Automated Release Process

We use GitHub Actions to automate the release process. The workflow is triggered when a new release is published to GitHub.

### How to Create a Release

1. Make sure all changes are merged to trunk
2. Update version numbers in:
   - `wp-feature-api.php` (`$wp_feature_api_version` and plugin header)
   - `package.json` (`version`)
   - `packages/*/package.json` (`version`)
3. Push these changes to trunk
4. Go to the GitHub repository and create a new release:
   - Click on "Releases" > "Draft a new release"
   - Choose a tag matching the version (e.g., `v0.1.3`)
   - Add a title and description detailing the changes
   - Publish the release

### What Happens

When you publish a release, the GitHub Actions workflow will:

1. **Build the Project**
   - Install all dependencies (npm and composer)
   - Build JavaScript bundles and assets

2. **Create WordPress Plugin ZIP**
   - Bundle all necessary files into a WordPress plugin ZIP
   - Upload the ZIP as a release asset
   - Also create a ZIP for the demo plugin

3. **Update Release Tag for Composer**
   - Add build files to the release tag
   - Packagist will use this tag with build files included

4. **Publish NPM Packages**
   - Publish client packages to npm
