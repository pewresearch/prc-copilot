## Version Management System

The WordPress Feature API includes a built-in version management system that enables multiple plugins to include their own copy of the API without conflicts.

* **Version Registry**: When a plugin includes the Feature API, the version automatically registers itself in a global registry.
* **Version Resolution**: During the `plugins_loaded` hook, the system determines the highest available version and only fully initializes that version.
* **Compatibility Layer**: All plugins register their features with the active (highest) version, regardless of which version they bundled.
* **How It Works**:
  1. Each plugin includes its copy of the Feature API via `require_once`
  2. When loaded, each version registers itself using `wp_feature_api_register_version()`
  3. The version resolver (`wp_feature_api_version_resolver()`) identifies the highest version
  4. The system will priortize a direct installation of the Feature API over a bundled version if they both have the same version string
  5. Only that version's code is fully initialized
  6. The `wp_feature_api_init` action is fired when initialization is complete
  7. All plugins register their features using this hook

## Repositories (`WP_Feature_Repository_Interface`)

The Feature API uses a repository pattern for storing and retrieving features.

* **Interface:** `WP_Feature_Repository_Interface` defines the required methods (`save`, `delete`, `find`, `query`, `get_all`, etc.).
* **Default:** `WP_Feature_Repository_Memory` provides a simple, non-persistent, in-memory store active during a single PHP request.
* **Extensibility:** Developers can create custom repository classes implementing the interface to store features differently (e.g., in the database using Custom Post Types or custom tables, integrating with an external registry).
* **Filtering:** The `query()` method handles filtering. The default memory repository performs basic filtering in PHP. More advanced repositories (like a database-backed one) could implement more efficient querying (e.g., SQL `WHERE` clauses, vector similarity search if embeddings were added). The `supports_native_query()` method allows a repository to indicate if it can handle certain query types more efficiently than the default PHP filtering.
* **Integration:** The repository pattern is key to potentially integrating external tool registries (like a central Automattic registry or community registries) directly into the Feature API, making external tools appear native alongside locally registered ones. This offers a unified interface for AI agents to discover and execute capabilities from both local and remote sources.

## Schema Adapters (`WP_Feature_Schema_Adapter`)

Different consumers, especially LLMs like OpenAI's models, have specific requirements or limitations regarding JSON Schema format for function/tool calling.

* **Purpose:** The `WP_Feature_Schema_Adapter` class provides a mechanism to transform the standard JSON Schema defined for a feature into a format compatible with a specific consumer.
* **Default (OpenAI):** The base class includes rules based on OpenAI's documented requirements (e.g., stripping unsupported keywords, making all properties required or nullable, setting `additionalProperties: false`).
* **Extensibility:** You can create subclasses of `WP_Feature_Schema_Adapter` to implement transformation rules for other LLMs or systems. Filters (`wp_feature_input_schema_adapter`, `wp_feature_output_schema_adapter`) allow specifying which adapter class to use.
* **Usage:** Adapters are applied automatically when retrieving schemas via `$feature->get_input_schema()` or `$feature->get_output_schema()`. This ensures that consumers like the REST API or potential MCP adapters receive a compatible schema format.

## Composability (Conceptual)

The discussion transcript mentions the idea of features calling other features.

* **Concept:** Similar to how functions call other functions, a complex feature could be built by orchestrating calls to several simpler, registered features.
* **Implementation:** This is not explicitly built into the current API structure but could be implemented within a feature's `callback`. The callback could use `wp_find_feature()` and `$feature->call()` to execute other features as needed.
* **Benefit:** Promotes modularity and reusability of granular features.
