### 1. Introduction & Overview

**What is the Feature API?**

The WordPress Feature API provides a standardized way to register and discover distinct units of functionality within a WordPress site. These units, called "Features," can represent either data retrieval actions (**Resources**) or data modification/creation actions (**Tools**).

It acts as a central registry, making it easier for different parts of WordPress, third-party plugins, themes, and external systems (like AI agents) to understand and interact with the capabilities available on a specific site.

**Core Concepts**

*   **Feature:** A distinct piece of functionality. It has a unique ID, a human-readable name and description, input/output definitions (using JSON Schema), permissions, and associated code (a callback function or a REST API alias).
*   **Resource:** A type of Feature used for *retrieving* data (read-only operations). Typically corresponds to `GET` requests in REST.
*   **Tool:** A type of Feature used for *performing actions* or *modifying* data (write/create/update/delete operations). Typically corresponds to `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` requests in REST.
*   **Registry:** A central, singleton object (`WP_Feature_Registry`) that holds all registered features. It provides methods for registering, unregistering, finding, and querying features.
*   **Repository:** An underlying storage mechanism for the registry (e.g., in-memory, database). The API defines an interface (`WP_Feature_Repository_Interface`) allowing for different storage backends. The default is in-memory (`WP_Feature_Repository_Memory`).
*   **Callback:** The PHP function or method executed when a Feature is called.
*   **Schema:** JSON Schema definitions for a Feature's expected input (`input_schema`) and its returned output (`output_schema`). This allows for validation and helps agents understand how to use the feature.
*   **Category:** A way to group related features for better organization and discovery.
*   **Eligibility (`is_eligible`):** A callback function that determines if a feature should be available in the current context (e.g., requires a specific plugin to be active).

**Goals and Benefits**

*   **Standardization:** Provides a single, consistent way to expose site capabilities.
*   **Discoverability:** Allows systems (like AI agents or UI components) to easily find available actions and data sources.
*   **Context-Awareness:** Enables features to be conditionally available based on the current environment or user context (`is_eligible`).
*   **Reusability:** Features defined once can be used by multiple consumers (e.g., a direct PHP call, a REST API request, an AI agent).
*   **Extensibility:** Designed for third-party plugins and themes to register their own features alongside core ones.
*   **Foundation for AI:** Provides the necessary building blocks (tools and resources) for AI agents operating within or interacting with WordPress core.

**Relationship with MCP (Model Context Protocol)**

The Feature API is **not** [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). MCP is a protocol specification for how AI agents and capabilities interact *between systems*.

The Feature API is a *WordPress-native* system for *registering and managing capabilities within a single WordPress site*. It is designed to be **compatible** with MCP. The intended pattern is:

1.  Plugins, themes, and core register their functionality as Features using this API.
2.  A separate **MCP Adapter** (another plugin or part of a larger AI system) reads the features from the Feature API registry. Here is Automattics' [MCP Adapter](https://github.com/Automattic/wordpress-mcp), which supports Feature API.
3.  The MCP Adapter exposes these registered Features as MCP Tools and Resources via the MCP protocol.

This separation allows the Feature API to remain focused on WordPress integration while enabling interoperability with the broader MCP ecosystem via an adapter layer.
