### 10. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Adapter
---

## 1. Feature API – The Local Source of Truth

The **Feature API** is the uniform way WordPress core, plugins, and themes register *capabilities* that can be invoked programmatically. Each `WP_Feature` definition includes:

* An **id**, **name**, and **description**
* Optional **input** and **output JSON Schema** definitions
* A **permission callback**
* A callable implementation (`$feature->call()`)

Inside WordPress, the Feature API (via `wp_get_features()` & friends) remains the *only* authoritative registry. Nothing is exposed externally until an adapter publishes it.

---

## 2. MCP Adapter Plugin (`wordpress-mcp`)

The [wordpress-mcp](https://github.com/Automattic/wordpress-mcp) plugin is an Adapter Plugin that maps registered `WP_Feature` objects to the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). Once installed and activated, it automatically turns your site into an MCP server that LLM hosts (Claude Desktop, VS Code extensions, etc.) can discover and invoke.

### How the adapter works

1. **Discovery** – Reads the `WP_Feature_Registry` to obtain all registered features that have opted-in to external exposure (via a flag such as `expose_via => [ 'mcp' ]`).
2. **Mapping** – Converts each `WP_Feature` into the corresponding MCP *tool* or *resource* definition:
   * `WP_Feature::$id` → MCP `id`
   * `WP_Feature::$name` → MCP `name`
   * `WP_Feature::$description` → MCP `description`
   * `input_schema` / `output_schema` → identical MCP JSON Schemas
3. **Execution** – When a client issues an MCP request:
   1. Locate the matching feature.
   2. Verify permissions.
   3. Invoke `$feature->call( $input )`.
   4. Return the response in the format MCP expects.

This design keeps the Feature API completely decoupled from any single integration standard while providing first-class support for *today's* predominant protocol.

## 3. Why an Adapter Layer?

* **Decoupling** – Core capabilities stay WordPress-specific; protocol concerns live in separate, replaceable plugins.
* **Experimentation** – New standards emerge quickly. By isolating protocol logic, WordPress can ship additional adapters without rewriting existing features.
* **Selective Exposure** – Individual features can declare which (if any) external protocols should see them.

## 4. Beyond MCP – Future Adapters

MCP is currently the leading standard for AI/LLM integrations, but it is **not** the only option on the horizon. Because adapters are just plugins, the community can easily implement support for:

* **FastAPI-style OpenAPI endpoints** – Useful for lightweight server-to-server integrations.
* **Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol** – An emerging spec for inter-agent communication.
* **Any other protocol** that gains traction.

Each additional adapter would follow the same pattern: read from the Feature API registry, translate metadata into the target spec, enforce permissions, and execute the feature callback.

## 5. Opt-in Exposure Example

This is not yet implemented, but the plan is to add a flag to the `register_feature()` function:

```php
register_feature(
    array(
        'id'                => 'myplugin/create_post',
        'name'              => 'Create Post',
        'description'       => 'Creates a new post from structured input.',
        'input_schema'      => $my_input_schema,
        'output_schema'     => $my_output_schema,
        'permission_callback' => 'can_create_posts',
        'callable'          => 'myplugin_create_post',
        // Expose this feature via MCP *and* FastAPI once those adapters are installed.
        'expose_via'        => array( 'mcp', 'fastapi' ),
    )
);
```

---

## 6. Summary

* The **Feature API** remains the canonical registry of callable capabilities within a WordPress site.
* The **wordpress-mcp plugin** publishes those capabilities over the **Model Context Protocol**, making them consumable by modern LLM tools.
* Thanks to the adapter pattern, WordPress can embrace additional protocols (FastAPI, Google A2A, etc.) as they mature—without touching existing feature code.

> **TL;DR:** Register once with the Feature API, and let adapter plugins handle the rest.
