### 7. Client-Side Features

While the core PHP classes primarily manage server-side features (executed within the WordPress backend), the Feature API also supports client-side features implemented in JavaScript and executed in the user's browser.

**The `@automattic/wp-feature-api` Package**

All client-side interactions (registration, execution, discovery) rely on the `@automattic/wp-feature-api` package. This package provides the necessary functions and manages a client-side registry mirroring the server-side one.

The `@automattic/wp-feature-api` package is designed to work as a singleton, provided by the main "WordPress Feature API" plugin. To use it in your own plugin's JavaScript:

1. **Main Plugin Active:** Ensure the "WordPress Feature API" plugin is installed and active on your site.
2. **Script Dependency:** When enqueuing your plugin's JavaScript file, you must declare `'wp-features'` (the script handle for the client SDK provided by the main plugin) as a dependency.
3. **Webpack Externals:** If you are using webpack (or a similar bundler), you should configure `@automattic/wp-feature-api` as an external module. This tells your bundler not to include the SDK code in your bundle and to instead use the version provided globally by the main plugin (via `window.wp.features`). Example:

   ```javascript
   // webpack.config.js
   externals: {
     '@automattic/wp-feature-api': 'wp.features',
     // Other WordPress externals...
   }
   ```

For detailed setup instructions, including `wp_enqueue_script` and webpack configuration examples, please refer to the [README in the client package](../packages/client/README.md).

Ensure this package is available and properly initialized in your client-side environment by following these setup steps.

## Registration

* **How:** Define the entire feature object (including `id`, `name`, `description`, `callback` function, and optionally `input_schema`, `output_schema`, `categories`, etc.) directly in your JavaScript code. Then, use the `registerFeature` function from `@wp-feature-api/client` to add it to the client-side registry.
* **Example:** The `@wp-feature-api/client-features` package uses this approach to register core editor features like inserting blocks or saving posts.

 ```javascript
 import { registerFeature } from '@automattic/wp-feature-api';

 const insertParagraph = {
  id: 'core/insert-paragraph',
  name: 'Insert Paragraph Block',
  description: 'Adds a new paragraph block to the editor.',
  type: 'action',
  location: 'client',
  callback: () => {
   // ... logic to insert paragraph block ...
   console.log('Paragraph inserted!');
   return { success: true };
  },
  // Optional schemas
  input_schema: { type: 'object', properties: {} },
  output_schema: { type: 'object', properties: { success: { type: 'boolean' } } }
 };

 registerFeature(insertParagraph);
 ```

## Execution

* **Client-to-Client:** Client-side code can directly discover and execute other registered client-side features using the `getRegisteredFeatures` and `executeFeature` functions from `@automattic/wp-feature-api`.
* **Server-Triggered Execution:** A purely server-side feature (PHP callback) *cannot* directly execute a client-side feature (JavaScript callback). However, a server-side process *can orchestrate* the execution of a client-side feature.
  * **Mechanism:**
        1. The server-side process (e.g., an AI agent interacting via the REST API, or a PHP request handler) discovers the client-side feature. This may require passing the allowed client-side features to the server-side process.
        2. The server sends a response or message to the client environment instructing it to execute the feature. This could be via a dedicated API response field (like `client_action` in the demo) or through a WebSocket message.
        3. The client-side code receives this instruction and uses the `executeFeature` function from `@automattic/wp-feature-api` to run the corresponding JavaScript callback with the provided arguments.
  * **Example:** The demo agent (`wp-feature-api-demo`) showcases this. The agent backend might decide to call the `demo/log-message` feature. It tells the frontend chat UI, which then uses `executeFeature('demo/log-message', { message: 'Hello from the agent!' })` from the client library to run the JS function. See `demo/wp-feature-api-agent/src/agent/wp-feature-tool-provider.ts` for an example of how the client library's `executeFeature` is used in this context.
